              <p class="is-class-5">
                this is a website specifically made for finding a parking at location that are put on the map or if you just want to find out how many parking spots may be available at that spot. while making this site the main inspiration came from the place i am currently living in. i live in Mumbai and if you ever tend to come around you will just happen to notice that finding a place to park will be like finding a mouse in a fiel. With taking this into consideration, i decided what if i could make a website which will give people an idea of how many parkings there may be at the place you are planning to park.
